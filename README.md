# Project in Molecular Life Science

This repository contains files from my Project in Molecular Life Science Course at Stockholm University

My dataset contains protein sequences and topologis for Globular (G), Globular + Signal Peptide (G+SP), Transmembrane (TM) and Transmembrane + Signal (TM + SP) peptide proteins. The aim of my project is to find a predictor for these proteins that makes a good prediction of the topololy of these proteins.
