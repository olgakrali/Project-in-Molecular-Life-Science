# Figures

Confusion Matrices for the three different classifiers. Thus for each classifier, there is a matrix (both for class_weight = None or 'balanced') from:

		30 tested sequences (60 trained),
		30 tested sequences (60 trained) PSSM,
		89 tested sequences (213 trained),
		89 tested sequences (213 trained) PSSM.


The matrices constitute very good indicators of how well every state was predicted

The final_figures file contains confusion matrices tested on the 89 sequencences for SVM, Random Forest and Decision Tree.
