# Train a SVM to a single sequence, topology and predict the topologies of another sequence

Today was Journal Club's and group meeting's day. We had two really nice presentations about deep learning and Kaggle competitions, 
which I found very informative. I am looking forward to the next journal club.

I did not do any coding today, since I finished yesterday, but I did some minor corrections on my scripts. As I described yesterday, I have
3 different scripts, but you have to run only the SVM_on_test_set.py. The other two scripts are called as modules by this script.
If you need to learn more details about the content of the 2 scripts (input_SVM_train.py and input_test_set.py), I fully describe their 
content in yesterday's diary entry. You can find these scripts under the folder Bin/Classifiers_code. While running the script, you will get two
graphs, one is the predicted vs true values with points (1 = Globular, 2 = Signal Peptide, 3 = Membrane), while the second figure is a confusion
matrix, where you can actually see how many topologies were predicted right or not. Saved figures can be found under the Figures folder.
