Today I worked from home with the final part of the sliding window; adding the extra windows (pads). It took me quite some time, since 
I wrote my thoughts and equations on the paper before I proceed. It took me some time, because  I am not used to solve mathematical problems yet (too much biology for the past 7 years), but I made it and it totally worth it. Now, that I have the right input I can continue with the SVM model and random forests that I left half way all these days. Comments about how I made the rest of the windows are 
written in the python file with details.

Tonight I will practise my speech for the group presentation tomorrow with my group. I would code more, but I have a deadline for my swedish class tonight and  I need to write a large argument text. So, I decided to skip coding for tomorrow.
