Today I went to the lab from 9- 12:30, to ask questions about my runall.py and if I can proceed with the code I already have.
It was suggested to me to do some minor, but really important changes that I have almost completed. I have done a new one hot encoder file 
with better commands to confirm the one hot encoders I got with through pandas. I also changed my sliding windows completely, since I did
the terrible mistake to add zeros in the aminoacid sequence first, now I have added the zeros to the sliding windows. 

But now I am in a very good way, since I have already:

a) made the sliding windows for a template peptide (of 6 amino acids)

b) transform each window into binaries from the keys and values extracted by my dictionary

Now I need to implement to my code the adding windows at the beginning and at the end and the corresponding binaries within them. This code
should work for every possible combination of windows size and appended 0s. I am writing my ideas in the paper before I will write a code,
since to me this is a tough mathematical problem and I will treat it as one. I think, if I solve this I can proceed with the SVMs, since I
got really good advice for John for improving my already existing code. 

Today, I also decided with some of my classmates for the group project presentation on Wednesday. I am really exited to show them how the 
TOPCONS web server works.
