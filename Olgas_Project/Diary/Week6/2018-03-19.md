# Monday 19 March, 2018

Today is the final submission of the project and the code. I have finished with the code, since Friday, but I wanted to double check everything before the
end of the deadline. During the weekend and this morning I worked with my report, which went really well and I got the final outcome I expected. 

The README.md file under the folder Final_Predictor will guide whoever reads it for running each model (SVM, SVM+PSSM data). Since the models are using a test
set of 89 proteins, it may take some time, but it worths it. The prediction txt files will appear on the Final_Predictor folder after running the scripts. 
For getting an idea over the other classifiers (RFC and Decision tree), you can go to the Results folder, and/or the Figures folder in the sub-folder final_figures. 

Last but not least, you are welcome to run the code for the 50 proteins with the unknown topology, which is also on the Final Predictor Folder. 

I would like to thank you for all the help during this course, because I have learnt a lot and I am more confident with my programming skills.
