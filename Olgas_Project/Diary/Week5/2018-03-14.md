Today I went to the lab to get some feedback on my remaining parts of the project. I was adviced to use the option 
class_weight = 'balanced' on my three classifiers, so I reran the evaluation for my RandomForest and Decision tree, since I got the 
worst predictions for them. I got indeed different parameters as optimum and I will reran and save the models based on the class_weight. 

According to that all my data will get similar weight, thus the Globular proteins will get less weight than they have, considering that my dataset
is unbalanced. Thus I could get better predictions for the other two states (Membrane and Signal Peptide). I am going to work with 
that tonight, then I will try larger dataset from my original dataset and then if I have time I will run the SVM with PSSM data for 
the 50 proteins, I have already predticted.
