Today was the day of the last Journal club and the Group meeting. I had some final questions, but I think I am mostly done with 
everything. Right now I am doing a last check out of my final predictor and I will upload the files and scripts under the folder Final_predictor. 
I also wrote a plan for my project report (on paper, not here) and I know what I should include. It helps me a lot to have a working plan, because I have moments with a lot of brainstorming and I need the good ideas written somewhere before I forget.

Overall, I am glad I made everything before the deadline despite my busy working schedule. I learnt a lot and I am sure that I will use this knowledge on my
future work. I am happy that I had the opportunity to work and think as a data scientist. Data processing takes a lot of time and needs a lot of patience, but I am learning day by day to be more efficient.
