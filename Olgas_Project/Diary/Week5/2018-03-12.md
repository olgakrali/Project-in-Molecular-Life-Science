Yesterday I ran the parameter evaluation for RandomForest Classifier and Decision tree. Then I trained my model for the same dataset as the SVM (60_prot.txt) and tested it on the test set subset_of_30_proteins.txt. The results from the confusion matrix are worse then the one of the SVM. I think that the reason is that the data is unbalanced with a lot of Globular residues (~87%). SVM performs very well on unbalanced data, but not the other two. If I have time I will try to find a way to solve it.

Today I went to the lab to continue with the PSSM. I divided my train and test Data Sets into one-sequence fasta files.Then I ran PSI blast for each sequence and I got as an output PSSM files and PSI blast files. Later today I will try to convert the results into SVM input to train my model once again.

Finally, after John suggested to use pickle instead of joblib to save our models, I modified my scripts and I have both. Unfortunately the RFC takes a lot of space and I could not upload it even in a compressed form.
