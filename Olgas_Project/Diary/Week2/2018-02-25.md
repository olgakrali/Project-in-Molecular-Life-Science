Today I modified my code, after reading a lot of examples and documentation in various sites apart from scikit learn. I splitted my data with the train_test_split function provided by sklearn. 
I tried training my test 

a) with the train set and then predict the test set, 

b) train with the whole X features and predict for the same data

I still need to figure out which is the best way to perform train the SVM model. I also changed some parameters for my classifier to get better and more robust predictions.
Finally, I run RandomForest classification, but I need to change some parameters to get better predictions scores. But overall I am pleased with the outcome of my code.

I also read my paper I need to present and I visited the TOPCONS web server, where I ran the example sequence. I am thinking of trying it for my dataset and add some nice figures to my final report. Right now I am working on my power point presentation for the paper.
