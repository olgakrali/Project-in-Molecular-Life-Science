Project in Molecular Life Science starts

Steps I followed today:

1) Create a sub-dataset with only 5 proteins (saved on the Datasets file as 'subset_of_5_proteins.txt'). Later, during the course I will run my scripts for the original large dataset.

2) Make a nested dictionary for the contents of the sub-dataset with the 5 proteins (Saved on the bin file as 'Dictionary5proteins.py').

3) Find relevant literature to my topic "Globular Transmembrane protein (TM) and signal peptide (SP)" (Saved on Docs/Papers_list).
I found 5 papers, but I have not decided yet if they will be my 5 final papers that I will send to Arne by Friday. 
However, I will read the papers by tomorrow, since they will help me to understand my topic better.

4) Looking for papers and information about SVM. I have worked on SVM in the past, but I did it in R and I want to learn how I will
achieve the same results with Python. This search will help me to build my project plan better. I have decided to start writing codes, after I will completely understand how I will transform my dataset into a form that is supported by sklearn SVM function (appropriate input).
