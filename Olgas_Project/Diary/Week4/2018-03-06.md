Today I am working on the feedback and suggestions I received yesterday at the lab. I have already normalized my data for a better visualisation
of the Confusion matrix. A matrix of the normalized data tested on 50 proteins is uploaded on the Figures folder. I also wrote a script 
(svm_classifier_evaluation.py), which I run remotely from my computer for a training set of 10 proteins. It still runs, thus I do not have the
best predictor for my case yet. While waiting I am planning to calculate the %s for each topology in the total number of the topologies of each
y input and compare it with the percentage of the predicted topologies I get. 

I may do some work with the other two types of classifiers tonight.
