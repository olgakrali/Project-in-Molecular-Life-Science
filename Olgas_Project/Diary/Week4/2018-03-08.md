# Thursday 8 March, 2018

Today, it was the presentations day, so half of the day I could not work. I came to KTH after the presentations to run my code for the
SVM parameters and window sizes evaluation. I actually modified some important scripts of my project and then I  made a script to get the percentage
of structural composition. I wanted to see if the subset I am using shares similar %s for each state. For my original dataset I got 
680740 globular residues (87.7%), 64432 membrane residues (9.46%)  and only 19033 signal peptide residues (2.795%). I tried my subset to be as 
close as possible to these percentages, while running the evaluation script. I also tested the %s in the final train and test set that I have
divided randomly and  I got similar results. Now, I know that my predictions will be built on a subset with similar properties as the big dataset.

Now I am waiting still at KTH waiting for results get ready, but it seems it is going to take longer than I thought. I may use smaller ranges for my parameters and
rerun it during the night. Until then I am writing some other scripts I will need after I get the results from the svm_evaluation.py.
