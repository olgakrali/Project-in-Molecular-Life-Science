Yesterday, I was running the GridSearchCV function for the svm model's different parameters (gamma, kernel, C), but it did not give
me any output and I decided to do it manually. With my way it runs, but I have a lot of parameters and when I will add the windows sizes it 
will take even longer. So I will focus on proceeding after the presentations, since I will have time to run my scripts for the rest of the day. 
PSSM did not work, but I probably did some minor mistakes and I will try to look it out. To avoid biases I will chose a subset
of proteins that have similar topologies composition, as my original dataset. I went to the SciLifeLab meeting today and I was working until now, 
so I will practice my speech for tomorrow's presentation and work on my code again from tomorrow.
