# Datasets


In this folder, all the small or larger datasets that were used during this project are stored. 

# Important files for the final predictor

Note that the final datasets used for the final predictor are: 

		
		a) eval_subset.txt for the parameter evaluation for the models (25 proteins)
		b) test.txt for training the models (213 proteins)
		c) test_finaldeataset.txt for testing the predictive ability of each model (90 proteins)


The files train_final.fasta and test_final.fasta were used to get separate fasta files for each sequence of the train and test set,
for PSI BLAST. The one-sequence fasta files are stored in another folder with the name 'PSSM'.
